# Undergraduate Research at the University of Osaka Japan
This is a subset of my research project done in the Summer 2023 term while I was an undergraduate researcher at the University of Osaka. As a member of LiveMechX Lab led by Professor Morishima Keisuke, I worked on many projects including the cyborg insect Urban Search and Rescue platform.
